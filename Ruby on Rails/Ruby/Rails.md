It is a MVC architecture

Model View Controller

Models are databases

We can swap out databases and nothing in our app changes changes. We can use sql or postgres and then swtich in between them 

Rails abstracts the database works

View are webpages.


Controller is the brain behind the scene. This makes the HTML work 

ANytime we create a webpage it needs to be routed. this is done in route.rb file

Rails has helper files that can do things for us. One of those things is generator which generates all kinds of things for us
