# API Testing

It allows us to check in details all of the parts of the existing apis.

It generally consists of making requests to a single resource or multiple API endpoints and validating the response for following aspects :-

- Performance
- Security
- Functional Correctness
- Status check

For API testing we can use a free tool called **PAW**.

*Note*: We cannot send a body with the API request in a GET request. We have to send a **params** if we want to send a request with a query using GET.
