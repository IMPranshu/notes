the Polygon PoS chain. What’s that? It's another chain that runs alongside the Ethereum and periodically submits checkpoints to it.

The [[Ethereum]] blockchain is referred to as a “layer 1” blockchain because we can build other blockchains on top of it. That’s exactly what the Polygon PoS chain is: it’s a blockchain built on top of Ethereum that runs in parallel, making it the second layer (hence, layer 2).
