The [[Polygon PoS chain]]. What’s that? It's another chain that runs alongside the Ethereum and periodically submits checkpoints to it.

Imagine you were running a kitchen as a chef. It’d be pretty annoying for you to have to take the order, go back to the kitchen, cook it, and then serve it. You’d get backed up with traffic pretty quickly! Instead, you would hire a team of waiters to act as a layer between the kitchen and the customers. The waiters would then take the orders more efficiently and give them to the kitchen directly.

This is similar to the relationship [[Ethereum]] has with Polygon

Since the Polygon PoS chain is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, everything that runs on Ethereum can also run on Polygon without any changes.

Polygon just makes a lot more sense because of how much faster and cheaper it is. All the popular Ethereum tools such as Hardhat, Remix, Truffle and Web3js work on Polygon; all you need to do is change the network you’re on!
