- [[Testnets]] are free and for testing smart contracts

- [[Mainnet]] cost money and are considered "live"

- Faucet is an application that gives us free test tokens like free test Rinkeby Ethereum

- [[Block Explorer]] is an application that allows us to **view** transactions that happen on a [[BlockChain]].
for ex - Etherscan

- [[Gas]] is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more gas you have to pay for.
Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a **gas fee** to node operators.
The amount of "gas" used and how much you pay depends on how **computationally expensive** your transaction is.
for ex - Sending ETH to 1 address would be cheaper than sending ETH to 1000 addresses.

- [[Hash]] is aunique fixed length string meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing said data into a **hash function**.

- [[Genesis block]] It is the first block in a blockchain, where the previous hash point to a hash that doesn't exist.

- [[Hash Algoritm/Function]] is a function that computes data into a unique hash.


- [[Mining]] the the process of finding the **solution** to the blockchain **problem**.Nodes get paid for mining blocks

- [[Block]] is a list of transactions mined together.

- [[decentralized network]] means having no single point of authority.

- [[Nonce]] is a **number used once** to find the **solution** to the blockchain problem.


- [[Private Key]] is only known to the key holder, it is used to **[[sign]]** transactions.


- [[Public Key]] is derived from your privatekey using a [[DSA]].Anyone can see it and use it to verify that a transaction came from you.

- [[Signature]] 

Private key |||| > Public Key > Address

- [[Proof of work]] 

- [[Consensus]] is the mechanism used to agree on the state if a blockchain 


- Chain Selection Rule - The rule that determines which chain is the real blockchain.
In Bitcoin and ethereum [[Nakamoto Consensus]] is used as the Chain Selection rule.

- Sybill Attack - When a user make psuedo- ananonymous accounts and try to oinfluence the blockchain.
- 51% Attack - 


- [[Layer 1]] refers to any base layer blockchain implementation
- [[Layer 2]] is any application that is added in top of the layer 1
