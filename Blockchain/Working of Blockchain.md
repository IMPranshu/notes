Users propose additions to the ledger by submitting transactions that transfer value from one account to another. User accounts are known as public keys (also called public address) and each public key has an associated private key. The public key is akin to an email address and the private key is similar to a password that the public key owner must enter (called a digital signature) to transfer funds stored on their address.

Pending transactions are grouped together into “blocks”, where they are processed and validated by each node in the network. Having each node check each transaction ensures that changes to the ledger are redundantly validated, making it nigh impossible to make malicious changes to the ledger or state of the network. For a transaction to be valid, the digital signature must be correct and the public key must have sufficient funds to cover the transaction.

Once a block is confirmed, it is appended to an ever-growing distributed ledger. The ledger is a continual chain of blocks linked using cryptography, and is thus termed a “blockchain”. Nodes are rewarded for their services with transaction fees and/or newly minted cryptocurrency (referred to as a block reward).
