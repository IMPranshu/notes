In the blockchain system, each node can agree that 1+1 = 2 but 
- blockchain can make random() calls because each node is going to get a different random number
- They also can't make nay api call as they because if a node makes an api call and another makes that call in some other time than the value received will be different. Also if another nodes tries to verify the transactions maybe 10 years later then the value returend from the API call may vary at that time too.
- Also if blockchain is making an API call then they are having conncetion with the external systmes which Layer 1 systems tends to avoid at all costs.

But the [[oracle ]]network can make contact with the external world and handle the geopolitical issues as well.
