Blockchain is the foundational technology that underpins the value proposition of the entire cryptocurrency/Web3 ecosystem. It’s the engine that secures Bitcoin and establishes the foundation for why [[Smart Contracts]] have value.
 
 The fundamental value proposition of blockchains is the ability to exchange value in a trust-minimized, permissionless way that doesn’t require the intermediation of any third party. The most basic case possible to showcase this is payments or the transfer of funds from one party to another.

 For example, let’s assume that Bob would like to send Alice a payment. Using legacy systems, Bob would send his payment to a third party—a bank or financial institution—that would take full custody of his funds and transfer those funds to Alice. In the case of blockchains, Bob sends money directly to Alice’s account without a centralized intermediary, but with full assurances that funds are transferred between accounts. The transaction takes place in a decentralized manner, without any intermediaries involved, enforced by deterministic processes secured by cryptography, encryption, math, and physics.

 ## [[Working of Blockchain]]

 A ledger is a book or computer file that keeps track of economic activity. Ledgers can track individual account balances and/or the ongoing movement of money within entire economies.

 Today, most ledgers are handled by centralized entities such as a bank, which maintain and store ledgers on their own servers in opaque databases.

A blockchain is a digital ledger that is stored and maintained by a [[decentralized network]] of computers. Each computer (node) in the network runs the same software and maintains, stores, and validates a copy of the ledger. Public blockchains use their own native asset known as a cryptocurrency to financially incentivize nodes to communicate with one another and reach an agreement (consensus) on the validity of the ledger.

 There are many different ways to [[Blockchain Design]], with each design having advantages and disadvantages.

 ## Benefits of Blockchain

Blockchains offer several value propositions not available in centralized systems.

-   **Security** – In a sufficiently decentralized blockchain, there is a very high probability that only valid transactions will be confirmed despite the efforts of malicious actors.
-   **Immutability** – Once a block is redundantly confirmed, it becomes a part of the unchangeable ledger that gets increasingly more difficult to alter over time.
-   **Reliability** – Blockchains have globally distributed networks with 24/7 uptime. They are always online and are not restricted geographically or politically.
-   **Peer-to-Peer** – Blockchains cut out intermediaries that siphon off value from transactions. Parties transact directly with each other without incurring any counterparty risk—the probability that the other participant in the contract will not fulfill their obligations.


## Conclusion

Blockchains create infrastructure that two or more parties can use to conduct highly secure, reliable, and tamper-proof economic exchange. The counterparty risk is shifted from reliance on probabilistic trusted third parties to reliance on deterministic open-source software that executes exactly as instructed. Companies become more efficient by avoiding reconciliations, removing unnecessary intermediaries, and reducing counterparty risk.
