Gas : Measure of Computation use

Gas Price : How much it costs per unit of gas

Gas Limit : Max amount of gas in a transaction

Transaction Fee : Gas Used * Gas Price

ex - 
21000 gas @ 1 GWEI per gas = 21000 GWEI


Gas price is based off the **demand** of the blockchain

The more people want to make transactions the higher the gas price and therefore the higher the transaction fees.
