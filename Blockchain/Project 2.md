Factory pattern of smart contracts


 Any time you wan tto interact with a contract you need 2 things:-
 - Address of the contract that you want to interact with
 - ABI known as Application Binary Interface(which we can get from the import statement)


import statemnt can be thought of as having two or more contracts together.

inheritance can be thought of as having all the funtions of the parent defined in the child class as well.
