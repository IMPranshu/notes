-   **Network Access & Participation** – Blockchains can vary in terms of how open or limited the network is to use and participate in. The three main types of blockchains: public (completely open), private (completely closed), and permissioned (open access, limited participation).
-   **[[Consensus]] Mechanism** – Blockchains can reach consensus about transactions through different means. Some of the most popular consensus mechanisms are proof of work (Bitcoin), proof of stake (Solana), and proof of authority (most private blockchains).
-   **Design Features** – Blockchains currently cannot satisfy all desired qualities. Instead, blockchains make tradeoffs to optimize certain feature sets over others between security, decentralization, and scalability — commonly known as the [[Scalability Trilemma]]. Other important design features include privacy, transaction finality, and more.
